# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
# Xcode
# Xcode automatically generates this directory with a .xcworkspacedata file and xcuserdata
# fastlane
# gitignore contributors: remember to update Global/Xcode.gitignore, Objective-C.gitignore & Swift.gitignore
# hence it is not needed unless you have added a package configuration file to your project
